## Basics

During the day, I work for [Pace](http://www.paceco.com), building websites and mobile experiences for Fortune 500 companies. In my other hours, I partner with other shops, small businesses, and organizations. 

I'm a generalist by nature, so I can tackle branding, illustration, UX (User Experience), UI (User Interface), and some back-end development, but I specialize in responsive websites and front-end development.

## Principles 

My guiding principles are **Efficiency &amp; Clarity**.

I work at all stages to keep my process as **efficient** as possible:

- As a one man team, you deal with me directly at all stages of the project. There is no middleman to pay.
- I work from home, keeping overhead low.
- I will always trend towards over-communication rather than under-communication, as it's the cornerstone of efficiency.

**Clarity** is what I strive for, not only in communication, but also in my designs:

- Minimalism is nice, but clarity is better&mdash;the clearest solution is not always the simplest one.
- Clear and effective design advocates for your users, your most important stakeholders.

## Other Points

- I will always look for the clearest, most efficient solution, not the one that will make me the most money.
- I am pretty knowledgeable, but I will tell you if I don't know something. 
- If I don't know something, I will do my best to find out (I love a challenge). 
- I'm a huge fan of [animated gifs](http://gim.ie/buixd), you WILL see them in my emails to you. Fair warning.
