## Basics

During the day, I work for [Pace](http://www.paceco.com), building websites and mobile experiences for Fortune 500 companies. In my other hours, I partner with other shops, small businesses, and organizations. While I have senior-level experience, I cost less than a typical consultancy because I'm able to reduce my overhead (you're not paying for my medical insurance) and I can work economically.

## Principles 

My guiding principles are **Efficiency &amp; Clarity**.

- As a single contractor with a wide skill set and experience, I can cut out any middleman processes and expenses.
- I work from home, keeping overhead small.
- Minimalism is nice, but clarity is better. The clearest solution is not always the simplest one.

## Inspiration

I love God and I love my family, both of those things are important to me and drive a lot of my decisions. This is why I work to be efficient, it allows me to spend more time with my family. If I can save YOU time and money, you will also have more time for the things you love! Win-win.

## Other Points

- I will always look for the clearest, most efficient solution, not the one that will make me the most money.
- I am pretty knowledgable, but I will tell you if I don't know something. 
- If I don't know something, I will do my best to find out. 
- I'm a huge fan of animated gifs, you WILL see them in my emails to you. Fair warning.
