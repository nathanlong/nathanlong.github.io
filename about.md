## Basics

During the day, I work for [Pace](http://www.paceco.com), building websites and mobile experiences for Fortune 500 companies. In my other hours, I partner with other shops, small businesses, and organizations. While I have senior-level experience, I cost less than a typical consultancy because I'm able to reduce my overhead (you're not paying for my medical insurance) and I can work economically.

## Guiding principles 

My guiding principles are **Efficiency &amp; Clarity**.

- As a single contractor with a wide skill set and experience, I can cut out any middleman processes and expenses.
- I work from home, keeping overhead small.
- Minimalism is nice, but clarity is better. The clearest solution is not always the simplest one.

## My Goals

I work to make focused, efficient, and clear experiences that help others reach their goals. I am passionate about creating things that will last and are easy to maintainâ€”if it's hard to use, no one will use it! I work to help engineer a path and process for companies and individuals to eliminate dead ends, save time, save money, and reduce effort.

## My Inspiration

I love God and I love my family, both of those things are important to me and drive a lot of my decisions. This is why I work to be efficient, it allows me to spend more time with my family. If I can save YOU time and money, you will also have more time for the things you love! Win-win.

## Other Points

1. I will always look for the clearest, most efficient solution, not the one that will make me the most money.
2. I am pretty knowledgable, but I will tell you if I don't know something. 
3. If I don't know something, I will do my best to find out.
