Hi, I'm Nathan Long. I've been creating websites since 1999.

I was formally trained as an artist and graphic designer, but I applied my visual skills to the web and dived right into the business of building websites. Since then, I've been able to help large companies like Walmart, Verizon, Wells Fargo, Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, USAA, plus several others including entreprenuers, startups, and other businesses.

My work has helped increase engagement on mobile devices as well as help increase business through better user experience and better performing websites.

Those are some of the official terms for what my work does, but my real goal is to help others build clarity out of the wild landscape that is the internet. The internet can be beautiful in its chaos... but that also makes it intimidating. I work to reduce the barrier between you, your users, and that wild web.

I currently live right outside of Greensboro, NC with my wife and two daughters.
