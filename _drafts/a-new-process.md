Outline:

Overview of the new process:

1. Visual Inventory / Discovery
2. Style Tiles
3. Element Collage
4. Prototype
5. Backend / CMS integration

Benefits:

- Moves design to the front of the process, and then moves layout to the end
- Gets the client involved in design earlier (many more micro meetings, less monolithic checkpoints)
- Results in better design feedback from the client, because that's all they have to look at
- Can SIGNIFICANTLY shorten the design phase of a project (no more super detailed comps!)

Disadvantages:

- Takes some education and setup to pull off effectively, but with proper framing can work well
- Easier to use on new projects, but could be difficult to transition active projects
- Can be difficult to part with the wireframe/comp deliverables

Notable Differences:

- No sharable wireframes, the wireframes are for the designer and internal team only to iterate quickly, they don't even enter the process until between stage 3 and 4
- Keeping layout out of the process results in more modular designing, we focus on pieces rather than pages.
- There are no formal comps or wireframes, once design is agreed upon, a code-based prototype is built, screens from the prototype become the new comp
