  <p><strong>No trackers? How will you know who visits your site?</strong></p>
  <p>I won't! But hey, YOU'RE here...</p>
  <p>I <em>do</em> load JavaScript on these pages, but it's the JavaScript I <em>want</em> to send for you. For funsies, not for tracking.</p>
  <p class="flow-2"><strong>But how will you know what content is performing well?</strong></p>
  <p>I won't! But I don't publish content for views, <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/20996">I publish for myself</a>. If someone is helped by something I wrote, I hope they will reach out like the beautiful 100% human-being they are and <a data-module="email-hider" data-no-replace>let me know</a>.</p>
