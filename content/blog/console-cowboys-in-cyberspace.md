In a blast of nostalgia I came across this old clip from the PBS show Ghostwriter:

<div class="feature">
<iframe style="aspect-ratio: 560/315; width: 100%; height: auto;" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bLlj_GeKniA?si=7ushXwH3ucHo3Sen" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

In addition to this encapsulation of a part of my early childhood, there's some immediate takeaways:

- Sick [Neuromancer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6088007-neuromancer) reference.
- We should all petition to change our titles to `Console Cowboys in Cyberspace`. ðŸ¤ 
- The idealistic representation of 90's hacker culture...

I think after decades of internet culture it's much easier to be pessimistic about the future, but the things we talk about that made the beginning of the internet great are still there, just covered up by so much other noise. 'Curiosity' and 'Imagination' haven't gone away, we just need to be more active in bringing them to the forefront!
