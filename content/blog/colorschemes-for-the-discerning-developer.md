That colorscheme in your editor...

...how long have you been looking at it? When did you change it last?

Years? Yeah, me too. ðŸ˜…

I recently took a spin to see what was new out there, and boy, are there some cool colorschemes!

I eventually settled on a lovely theme called [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/) (specifically the Mocha variant, the darkest one). But here are some of the others I came across. Maybe there's something here to give your editor a nice new coat of paint as well!

## Multi-Editor Colorschemes

These colorschemes have multiple ports, making them a nice way to extend it across all your tooling.

- **[Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/)**
  - Beautifully balanced pastels pop off a dark blue background. It also has one of the nicest light variants I've seen.
- **[RosÃ© Pine](https://rosepinetheme.com/)**
  - Another balanced theme with multiple variations... This palette trends towards warmer natural colors.
- **[Tokyo Night](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim)**
  - This was my pick before Catppuccin. I liked it so much that I used some of the colors here on my site! It celebrates the neon of Tokyo nights.
- **[Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/)**
  - A nice dark scheme with an amazing amount of ports and implementations. Slightly darker than Catppuccin and RosÃ© Pine. The purple and orange feel especially thematic.
- **[Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/)**
  - The power of BLUE! It's bold and STRONG.
- **[Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/)**
  - This was the OG theme that felt like real consideration had been put into the colors. I consider this the predecessor of most of these themes and it's STILL a pretty solid choice.
- **[Oceanic Next](https://github.com/voronianski/oceanic-next-color-scheme)**
  - A slightly desaturated palette, this sits somewhere in between Solarized and Tomorrow Night.
- **[Tomorrow Night](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme)**
  - Bold color choices, and nice if you don't want a blue background.
- **[Iceberg](https://github.com/cocopon/iceberg.vim)**
  - High contrast, bluish theme. Feels like if you turned down the lights on Nord a bit.
- **[One Half](https://github.com/sonph/onehalf)**
  - Based on Atom's 'One' colorscheme, a practical mix of colors on a gray (or light gray!) background.

## NeoVim Only

These colorschemes are mostly for Vim/NeoVim, but many have other ports.

- **[Kanagawa](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim)**
  - Based on the Katsushika Hokusai painting of the same name, this theme has some unique colors giving it a different feel.
- **[OneDark](https://github.com/navarasu/onedark.nvim)**
  - Another Atom One Dark successor, with TreeSitter support.
- **[Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)**
  - One of the few themes that feels like distinctly its own thing. It has retro vibes that make me nostalgic for the green and amber-colored displays of the past.

## Decorating your 'Personalized Development Environment'

I have always liked TJ DeVrie's concept of the [PDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVIJhC9Veg), of creating an ENVIRONMENT that's JUST YOURS and a joy to use. One of the best ways I know of to personalize a space is with color. So what does YOUR colorscheme say about you? If it's not speaking to YOU, maybe it's time to change it up!
