I mentioned last year that I was working on a series on [building motion for the web](../building-motion-for-the-web/). Well, that series turned into a talk, and we recorded it.

In it, I talk about:

- Ways to **Classify** motion to help build shared language when talking about types of motion for the web.
- Building a '**Complexity** tier list' for motion to help assist in planning.
- Some recommended Collaboration methods for designing and implementing motion.

(You see the 3 C's in there? Alliteration FTW ðŸ˜Ž)

You can check the full thing out below.
