At Viget we have a tradition of weekly rotating [LabShares](https://www.viget.com/articles/traditions-gratitude-one-way-we-stay-connected-at-viget/), which are a 10-12 minute presentations on ANYTHING the presenter is passionate about. We've talked about coffee, aloha shirts, sunscreen, adult autism, and many many other interesting topics.

Recently, I was privileged to present my recent thinking on the nature of creativity and how we can continue to create even during the busiest seasons of our life.

Hey friends,

Today I want to talk about the curious problem of creating while adulting.

1. Why we stop creating.
2. Why we should create.
3. What EVEN IS creativity.
4. And some things we can do to nurture it, even while adulting.

But first, a disclaimer. The following content is Rated O for Opinion and contains questionable research mixed with my own experiences and speculation. It’s my opinion and how I’ve come to think about creativity.

Like many of us, when I was young I spent a lot of time creating and playing.

Lego sculptures, play acting — usually as…

They fearlessly create from their inner selves.

They’re not concerned with how it looks as much as the process: the smell of those Crayola markers, the feeling of pencil on paper.

"The Gap" is a term [defined by Ira Glass](https://vimeo.com/85040589) and it describes the discrepancy between your creative taste and your creative skill.

Although typically when you first encounter it looks more like:

  <div class="slide-text flow">

A chasm.

Through exposure to great work your inner sense of quality—your taste—has developed enough for the skill of your OWN work to become a disappointment to you.

It may not have been one particular revelation but a slow confidence drain from critical review or rejection.

This was my experience when I saw the work of Todd McFarlane, Akira Toriyama, and many others. I was enthralled by their work and knew what I was producing wasn’t the same quality.

So I copied, I traced, I riffed, and I kept going. These are some of my high school drawings.

But creating had changed for me, it was no longer JUST for joy of creating — I had something to prove now, an inner tension.

Which… isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it can be a consuming thing.

Our taste tends to improve faster than our skill leading to confidence spirals.

When I look at something I’ve created I can VERY EASILY see everything that’s wrong with it, what I could have/should have done differently.

When I graduated with a BFA and got a real job, things got busy fast.

But you have to see that creativity for what it is.

Because creativity is not a talent, it is a mode of thinking.

So let’s think about thinking for a bit

John Cleese has a [famous talk on creativity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5oIIPO62g) that’s helpful here. (And I've already started referencing it).

In it, Cleese describes two modes of thinking:

  <div class="slide-text flow">

The Open mode:

Which is relaxed, expansive, humorous, curious. It’s not under pressure.

  <div class="slide-text flow">

And the Closed mode:

Which is a heads down, purposeful, it’s work-mode. It can be either pleasurable or stressful — sometimes both, depending

  </figure>

  <div class="slide-text flow">

You need both modes.

If you only stay in the open you never get anything done.

If you only stay in the closed mode means going through life with our heads down.

But we need a few things to help move us into the open mode.

  </div>
</div>

<div class="slide">

You need space, the ability to seal yourself or you and your collaborators off.

  </figure>

  <div class="slide-text flow">

You need time to create boundaries, To reserve that time for yourself, because it TAKES TIME to get into the open mode. It’s not a switch you can turn on and off.

  <div class="slide-text flow">

You also need MORE time to stick with the problem, to tolerate the discomfort of an unsolved problem and not always take the first solution.

  <div class="slide-text flow">

You need confidence, because a fear of mistakes blocks creativity.

Try to be open to anything in this mode.

  </figure>

  <div class="slide-text flow">

And then finally, we need humor. An attitude of humor allows play to happen, to ask “What if”, to explore silly ideas that you’d never normally consider.

Humor is what brings us into the open mode faster than anything else.

However, when you’re also attempting to adult at the same time, I think we need three additional things to help us find this open mode:

We’ve already talked about how our energy is finite.

But some of us have energy tanks that look like this:

Energy parasites. They’re taking energy, not giving it.

Doomscrolling, distractions, vapid entertainment, even negative people.

For me personally, I found almost all social media was eating up a lot of energy just to engage with it. So I cut it out of my life.

It’s going to be different for you, but if our energy is finite, what are we doing to protect it?

I wanted to do it on my own, I’m an introvert after all, but the branch can’t produce fruit without the support of the rest of the tree.

The water and nutrients from the sap and leaves. Even the bees that pollinate the flowers.

Without a community we’re just a lone branch.

We need people who encourage us, support us, help us along the way. We’re not designed to live life alone.

So who or what are you connected to? What does your community look like?

Freak energy is one part curiosity, one part humor, one part weird (and weirdness is subjective).

Everyone has something you could go on forever about, you can't read enough of it, you don't tire of it, you can do it again and again and it remains enjoyable.

And the joy of this can help pull you through a slump.

For me it’s games. Specifically game RULES. I can read rulebooks all day and learning a new game is an enticing brain puzzle that I can hardly put down.
