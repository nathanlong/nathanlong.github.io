A group of Master Crafters once left their sanctuary to see for themselves the state of craftsmanship in the world.

The first place they came to was a sign factory. They witnessed workers using machines to pull individual letters from a shared stock and placing them onto signs of all different materials.

"Woe is us!" cried the Crafters, "They shall never learn the underlying material! See how the machine changes its form for the workers by the material used? Rock, stone, and wood all become the same! By assembling it from shared pieces they will never know true craftsmanship!"

"Shame and Woe!" the Crafters cried together and they left.

The next place they came to had a machine shaped like roots. Workers poured in materials from the top, while other workers added roots and channels. As the roots repositioned themselves the machine duplicated the final position into an image.

"Woe is us!" cried the Crafters, "They have duplicated the fundamentals! See how one person cannot grasp the complexity of the roots, each piece is encapsulated and abstract! By not creating the image from the true fundamentals they will never know true craftsmanship!"

"Shame and Woe!" the Crafters cried together.

But a worker approached the Crafters. "Honorable Crafters, your skill is legendary, you are greatly revered by us all, but see how this machine allows us to create new images from the same pieces? I am slowly learning and one day I hope to be a true Crafter like you, but I cannot yet forsake my family to devote myself wholly to the Craft."

"You will never be a true Crafter, your tools corrupt you, depart from us!" the Crafters cried. The worker went away discouraged. The Crafters returned to their sanctuary to continue making beautiful things as they had before.

The problem is not the tools, the problem is, and always will be, people and the problems THEY face.
